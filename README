This folder contains all my configuration files for the FOSS network computing infrastructure.
Everything is installed on a single server.

Below I would like to list references for how I setup everything:

Samba4
Install Samba4 AD DC on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Make sure to provision rfc2307 and to visit the pre-requisites page.

Pre-requisites:
Your /etc/network/interfaces, /etc/hosts and /etc/hostname should look similar to the example files I have provided.
Must enable ACL's for ext4 file system run: 
nano /etc/fstab
Add the following line after the ext4 file system should look something like: 
/dev/...          /srv/samba/demo          ext4          user_xattr,acl,barrier=1          1 1
then run: mount -a
Now we need to install pre-requisites for Samba4 run:
apt-get install build-essential libacl1-dev libattr1-dev \
   libblkid-dev libgnutls-dev libreadline-dev python-dev libpam0g-dev \
   python-dnspython gdb pkg-config libpopt-dev libldap2-dev \
   dnsutils libbsd-dev attr krb5-user docbook-xsl libcups2-dev acl ntp
Kerberos will prompt for details such as your domain and administrative servers.. I entered the IP of my server.

Now we are ready to install Samba 4:
On Ubuntu 14.04 LTS run apt-get install samba 
After Samba4 has finished installing run the following provisioning command:
samba-tool domain provision --use-rfc2307
You will be prompted for details... Most by default are correct. Change DNS forwarder to 8.8.8.8 and use a password that contains atleast one capital letter, one number and seven charactors altogethor.
You now have a fully functional DC! To start Samba4 run:
sudo samba
Test authentication using account made in provisioning:
smbclient //localhost/netlogon -UAdministrator -c 'ls'
Test DNS by running the following make sure you replace sandom.example.com with your own domain name: 
host -t SRV _ldap._tcp.samdom.example.com.
host -t SRV _kerberos._udp.samdom.example.com.
host -t A dc1.samdom.example.com.
The commands should output something like:
_ldap._tcp.samdom.example.com has SRV record 0 100 389 dc1.samdom.example.com.
_kerberos._udp.samdom.example.com has SRV record 0 100 88 dc1.samdom.example.com.
dc1.samdom.example.com has address 192.168.1.1
Otherwise you will need to go back and check your DNS settings.
Test Kerberos noting that the domain is all CAPS:
kinit administrator@SAMDOM.EXAMPLE.COM
Run the following so your administrator account doesn't expire:
/usr/local/samba/bin/samba-tool user setexpiry administrator --noexpiry 
Configure NTP
Add your ntp servers here /etc/ntp.conf
To find ntp servers for NZ or anywhere else go to: http://www.pool.ntp.org/zone/nz
Then run:
service ntp stop 
ntpdate 0.nz.pool.ntp.org
ntpq -p

Configure shares.
Refer to my smb.conf
Also read:
https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Setup_and_configure_file_shares
Management: For the sake of simplicity use Microsoft RSAT tool. To make the AD account compatible with unix you must using the RSAT tool ,create the user/group and then: right click user/group > properties > unix tab to map the unix UID/GID.  

LTSP
Install diskless fat client functionality.
sudo apt-get install ltsp-server-standalone
You can refer to my dhcpd.conf files
DHCP files should be located in /etc/ltsp/dhcpd.conf and /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf both must be configured inorder for ltsp to work.
To build a fat client refer to the ltsp-build-client.conf file
The next step will take awhile depending on you machine hardware and internet connection.
Then finally run:
sudo ltsp-build-client
If you are using an additional NIC for the ltsp clients you must refer to:
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuLTSP/ThinClientHowtoNAT

LDAP client authentication
Need this to authenticate LTSP clients using single sign on credentials provided by the SAMBA4 AD DC.
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LDAPClientAuthentication
Also you must refer to my ldap.conf file inorder for it to work with SAMBA4 AD DC.

FreeRadius and Coova Chilli
Authenticate users using single sign on credentials.
http://deployingradius.com/documents/configuration/active_directory.html
http://www.netclique.in/2013/07/campus-wi-fi-with-coovachilli.html
My chilli file refers to /etc/chilli/config

OwnCloud Server
Install OwnCloud and configure in GUI
http://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=isv:ownCloud:community&package=owncloud
You can install the ldap backend feature under apps to use single sign on.

Mounting shares using pam_mount
sudo apt-get install libpam-mount
sudo nano /etc/security/pam_mount.conf.xml
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently
also refer to my conf file /etc/security/pam_mount.conf.xml
My example allows users to access a public folder called Pool where they can place files for anyone on the network to see.
