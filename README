This folder contains all my configuration files for the FOSS network computing infrastructure.
Everything is install on a single server.

Below I would like to list references for how I setup everything:

Samba4

Configure shares.

Management: For the sake of simplicity use Microsoft RSAT tool

LTSP
Install diskless fat client functionality.

DHCP files should be located in /etc/ltsp/dhcpd.conf and /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf both must be configured inorder for ltsp to work.

LDAP client authentication
Need this to authenticate LTSP clients using single sign on credentials provided by the SAMBA4 AD DC.
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LDAPClientAuthentication
Also you must refer to my ldap.conf file inorder for it to work with SAMBA4 AD DC.

FreeRadius and Coova Chilli
Authenticate users using single sign on credentials.
