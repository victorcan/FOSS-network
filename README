This folder contains all my configuration files for the FOSS network computing infrastructure.
Everything is installed on a single server.

Below I would like to list references for how I setup everything:

Samba4
Install Samba4 AD DC. Make sure to provision rfc2307 and to visit the pre-requisites page. 
http://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Samba_AD_DC_HOWTO
Configure shares. 
https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Setup_and_configure_file_shares
Management: For the sake of simplicity use Microsoft RSAT tool. To make the AD account compatible with unix you must using the RSAT tool ,create the user/group and then: right click user/group > properties > unix tab to map the unix UID/GID.  

LTSP
Install diskless fat client functionality.
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuLTSP/FatClients
DHCP files should be located in /etc/ltsp/dhcpd.conf and /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf both must be configured inorder for ltsp to work.
To install applications for the images

LDAP client authentication
Need this to authenticate LTSP clients using single sign on credentials provided by the SAMBA4 AD DC.
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LDAPClientAuthentication
Also you must refer to my ldap.conf file inorder for it to work with SAMBA4 AD DC.

FreeRadius and Coova Chilli
Authenticate users using single sign on credentials.
http://deployingradius.com/documents/configuration/active_directory.html

My chilli file refers to /etc/chilli/config

OwnCloud Server
Install OwnCloud and configure in GUI
http://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=isv:ownCloud:community&package=owncloud
You can install the ldap backend feature under apps to use single sign on.

Mounting shares using pam_mount
sudo apt-get install libpam-mount
sudo nano /etc/security/pam_mount.conf.xml
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently
also refer to my conf file /etc/security/pam_mount.conf.xml
My example allows users to access a public folder called Pool where they can place files for anyone on the network to see.
