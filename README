This folder contains all my configuration files for the FOSS network computing infrastructure.

Below I would like to list references for how I setup everything:

Samba4
Install Samba4 AD DC. Make sure to provision rfc2307.

Management:For the sake of simplicity use Microsoft RSAT tool

LTSP
Install diskless fat client functionality.
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuLTSP/FatClients
DHCP files should be located in /etc/ltsp/dhcpd.conf and /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf both must be configured inorder for ltsp to work.

LDAP client authentication
Need this to authenticate LTSP clients using single sign on credentials provided by the SAMBA4 AD DC.
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LDAPClientAuthentication
Also you must refer to my ldap.conf file inorder for it to work with SAMBA4 AD DC.
